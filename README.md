## 🌟 Why This Repo?

Medical image segmentation research often struggles with **non-reproducible experiments** — different splits, preprocessing, and logging styles make fair comparison impossible.  
**MedSegBench-SegLab** solves this by providing a **unified, reproducible, and Colab-friendly lab** 🧠 where every dataset follows an identical **13-step benchmark pipeline**, letting researchers simply plug in their models and compare fairly.

You focus on your model 🧩 — we handle the rest.

> 💡 While conducting my research on developing a **TransUNet-Lite**, I originally built this notebook to **train and evaluate my own models**.  
It has since been tested on **three architectures** — one standard **TransUNet** and **two novel lightweight variants** that I designed during my experiments.


---

## 📦 What’s Inside

This repository includes complete **segmentation benchmark notebooks** built over the **MedSegBench datasets** (35+ datasets, 60,000+ medical images 🏥), covering both:

- 🩸 **Binary Segmentation** — single foreground class (e.g., tumor vs. non-tumor)
- 🩺 **Multi-Class Segmentation** — multiple organs, lesions, or tissue regions *(coming soon...)*

Each notebook is **Colab-ready**, self-contained, and follows the exact same structure for **fair apples-to-apples model comparison** 🍎🍏.

---

> ⚙️ **Note:**  
> I’ve run **each dataset notebook for 1 epoch** 🧪 — just to confirm that all components (dataset paths, file structures, augmentations, and DataLoaders) work correctly and the pipelines execute without errors.  
> The only exception is the **Covid19Radio project**, which I haven’t executed yet but am confident will work flawlessly given its identical structure.  
>  
> This limited run was purely for **functional validation** and not full model training. You can perform full training yourself directly in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook** by simply running all cells end-to-end.

## 🧩 What Does Each Notebook Include?

Each notebook follows a **13-step universal pipeline**:

1. **Environment & Libraries** — Import and setup GPU, print versions  
2. **Dataset Download** — Fetch MedSegBench NPZ and verify MD5  
3. **Config & Reproducibility** — Fixed seed, configs, and environment dump  
4. **Predefined Splits** — Load dataset splits (no re-splitting)  
5. **Preprocessing & Augmentations** — Normalize and augment  
6. **🧠 MODEL BLOCK** — ✨ *Your playground!* Paste your custom model here  
7. **Losses & Metrics** — Dice, IoU, BCE, CrossEntropy  
8. **Training & Logging** — AdamW, CosineLR, mixed precision, CSV logs  
9. **Plotly Curves** — Interactive training/validation curves  
10. **Test Evaluation** — Frozen checkpoint, compute metrics  
11. **Inference Speed Test** — Measure latency & VRAM  
12. **Threshold & Calibration** — PR/ROC, AUPRC, AUROC, ECE  
13. **Qualitative Visuals** — Image overlays, boundaries, grid outputs  

Everything—training logs, checkpoints, figures, summaries—is saved automatically.  
Just modify Step 6 and re-run the notebook end-to-end!

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open any notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter**.  
2. Set your `MEDSEGBENCH_DIR` (where datasets are cached).  
3. Go to **Step 6 — MODEL BLOCK** and paste your model (e.g., U-Net, TransUNet, SwinUNet).  
4. Run all cells — that’s it! 🚀  

Each notebook runs completely standalone.  
For demonstration, we’ve used **TransUNet 🧬** as an example model.

## 🧠 Dataset Overview

**MedSegBench** is a large-scale collection of **35+ medical image segmentation datasets** standardized for fair benchmarking.  
It includes over **60,000+ images** from modalities like:

- 🩺 **Dermoscopic (ISIC 2016/2018)**
- 🫁 **CT / MRI (Brain, Liver, Heart)**
- 🩻 **X-ray & Ultrasound (Chest, Abdomen, Musculoskeletal)**  

Each dataset is provided in `.npz` format with **predefined splits**, **unified resolution (128/256/512)**, and **MD5 verification** for reproducibility.

# 🩸 Binary Segmentation Projects

Binary segmentation focuses on separating **foreground (e.g., lesion/tumor)** from **background**, perfect for lightweight and diagnostic models.  
Each notebook here follows the 13-step standard pipeline and only changes **dataset name** and **Step 6 model**.

You can plug in **your custom architecture**, evaluate it under **identical conditions**, and visualize results with live **Plotly curves**, **Dice/IoU comparisons**, and **qualitative overlays**.  
All metrics, speed, and calibration plots are generated automatically — so benchmarking becomes effortless! ⚡

# 🩺 Multi-Class Segmentation Projects

Multi-class segmentation deals with **organ-level** or **region-level** predictions, where multiple anatomical structures are labeled simultaneously.  
The same 13-step framework extends naturally to multi-class datasets with per-class metrics, confusion matrices, and class-wise calibration.

> (Coming soon in v2 release — support for AbdomenUSMSBench, Polyp, and OrganSeg datasets 🧬)

## 🧠 Step-6 Plug-and-Play Segmentation Models  

This folder contains ready-to-use **model blocks** for **Step 6 — MODEL BLOCK** of the Seg-Lab pipeline 🧩.  
Each notebook is a *plug-and-play* segment that can be inserted directly into any dataset notebook (ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI …).  

> ⚠️ These model notebooks are **not standalone**—they rely on the Seg-Lab pipeline (Steps 0–5 & 7–13). Running them alone will cause missing-context errors.

---

### 🔧 Standard Copy-Paste Flow (for all models)

Each model has **4 cells** that you must copy in order:

1️⃣ **Cell 1/4 — Imports & Wrapper**  
   - Copy imports and the `SMPWrap` (or equivalent).  
   - Ensures `forward(x) → {"logits": (B, C, H, W)}` for pipeline compatibility.  

2️⃣ **Cell 2/4 — Builder Function**  
   - Copy the `build_*()` definition.  
   - Confirm:  
     - `in_channels = 3`  
     - `classes = C` (→ `1` for binary, `>1` for multiclass)  
     - `activation = None` (loss handles activation).  

3️⃣ **Cell 3/4 — Instantiate & Shape Check**  
   - Creates the model instance and runs a quick shape verification using a sample batch from the dataloader.  
   - Ensures that the output tensor matches the required format `{"logits": (B, C, H, W)}` for smooth integration with the pipeline.  
   - Optionally sets a `MODEL_TAG` for naming checkpoints and logs.  

4️⃣ **Cell 4/4 — Parameter Count (Optional)**  
   - Calculates the total number of trainable parameters in the model and prints them for reference.  
   - Helps estimate the model’s size, complexity, and hardware requirements.


> ✅ Once inserted, no edits are needed — the pipeline automatically manages training, metrics, visualization, calibration, and speed/VRAM benchmarking.  

> ⚙️ **Additional Tweaks:**  
> - After pasting the model, go to **Step 8 (Model Training, Cell 1)** and update the line  
>   `model = model_name` → replace it with your selected model’s variable (e.g., `model = unet_r34_model`).  
> - *(Optional)* In **Step 0**, you may also rename the `MODEL_TAG`, change artifact paths, or update directory names for logs, checkpoints, and figures to better organize your runs.

> 🧩 **Note:**  
> The above **three models (U-Net, U-Net++, and DeepLabV3+)** are derived from one of my main learning and experimental project in the **Vision4Healthcare** repository:  
> 🔗 [UNet Family vs DeepLabV3+: Strong, Efficient Baselines on ISIC-2016](https://github.com/HussamUmer/Vision4Healthcare/tree/main/SegCompare_ISIC2016_UNetFamily_DeepLabV3Plus)  
>  
> That project served as the foundation for these Step-6 plug-and-play models.


---

### ✅ Before Running
- [ ] Correct `C` value (Binary → 1; Multiclass → #classes).  
- [ ] `forward(x)` returns `{"logits": B × C × H × W}`.  
- [ ] `IMAGE_SIZE` matches dataset (128 / 256 / 512).  
- [ ] `AMP_ON` (mixed precision) can remain True.  

> 🔧 I’m actively adding more **Step-6 plug-and-play models**. If anyone have a favorite architecture, open a PR or request it — I’ll add it to the collection ✨
